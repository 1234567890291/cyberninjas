            <p>A vulnerability is a weakness in a system that can be exploited by a threat to gain unauthorized access or cause damage. An exposure, on the other hand, is a situation where a vulnerability is accessible or exposed to potential threats but may not be actively exploited. In essence, vulnerabilities are the weaknesses, while exposures are the conditions that make those weaknesses visible or reachable.</p>

        <div class="answer" id="q2-answer">
            <p>Regularly updating software and firmware is crucial because updates often include patches for newly discovered vulnerabilities and security flaws. Without these updates, systems remain susceptible to known exploits and malware that can take advantage of outdated software. Keeping software current ensures better protection against evolving threats and enhances overall system security.</p>

        <div class="answer" id="q3-answer">
            <p>Multi-factor authentication (MFA) adds an extra layer of security by requiring users to provide two or more verification factors to gain access to an account or system. This typically includes something they know (password), something they have (security token or phone), and something they are (biometric data). MFA significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access, even if an attacker has compromised the password.</p>

        <div class="answer" id="q4-answer">
            <p>Public Wi-Fi networks are often less secure than private networks, making them vulnerable to attacks. Risks include data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, and session hijacking. Attackers can potentially eavesdrop on your internet activity or inject malicious software. To mitigate these risks, avoid accessing sensitive information over public Wi-Fi or use a virtual private network (VPN) to encrypt your connection.</p>

            <p>Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities. Attackers manipulate individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Examples include phishing emails, pretexting, and baiting. Awareness and training are essential for recognizing and defending against social engineering tactics.</p>

            <p>A cybersecurity incident response plan is a predefined strategy for detecting, managing, and mitigating security incidents. It outlines roles and responsibilities, procedures for containment and recovery, and communication protocols. Having a well-defined plan helps organizations respond swiftly to incidents, minimize damage, and recover effectively, reducing the overall impact on business operations.</p>
